🔮 Customer Churn Prediction
This project uses machine learning to predict customer churn — helping businesses understand which customers are likely to leave and why. Built with Python and trained on real customer behavior data, the model provides actionable insights using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

🚀 Overview
Using features like:

⏳ Tenure – how long a customer has subscribed

🔁 Usage Frequency – how often they use the service

☎️ Support Calls – number of times they needed help

💸 Payment Delay – how late they pay

…the model predicts whether a customer will stay or churn.

🧠 Algorithms:
Logistic Regression

Random Forest

XGBoost

📊 Evaluation Metrics:
AUC-ROC

F1 Score
